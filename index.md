# About Me
---


I am a third year Macaulay Honors student studying computer science at
the City College of New York. I am currently an intern at Cornell Tech under Professor Yoav Artzi, developing interactive 3D environments for situated natural language understanding. I enjoy trying different,
and hopefully easier, alternative solutions to problems when I code. When I'm not
working on projects I enjoy playing FPS games, watching eSports and reading fantasy novels.

Apparently, I like to code. ¯\ _(ツ)_/¯
