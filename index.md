# About Me
---


I am a second year Macaulay Honors student studying computer science at
the City College of New York. This summer I will be interning at Cornell Tech under Assistant Professor, Yoav Artzi. I enjoy trying different,
and hopefully easier, alternative solutions to problems when I code. When I'm not
working on projects I enjoy playing FPS games, watching eSports and reading fantasy novels.
