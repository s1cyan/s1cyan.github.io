# About Me
---


Software Dev in hybrid cloud at IBM. I do networking and things! Previously I have worked with Cornell Tech's NLP group, under Professor Yoav Artzi, on interactive simulated house environments for natural language learning research using Unity5. The projects sections of this website will have more detail about what I have worked on as well as links to their repos.
