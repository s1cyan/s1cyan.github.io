# About Me
---


I am a Computer Science major in my senior year with proficiency in C#, C++, Python and Perl. Previously I have worked with Cornell Tech's NLP group, under Professor Yoav Artzi, on interactive simulated house environments for natural language learning research using Unity5. My personal website: http://s1cyan.github.io/ , has more details on what I have worked on as well as what I am currently working on. Each project will have a link to their corresponding repositories.
