# About Me
---


I am a second year Macaulay Honors student studying computer science at
the City College of New York. Being relatively new to coding, I find
that I am gradually getting the hang of things. I enjoy trying different,
and hopefully easier, alternative solutions to problems when I code. When I'm not
working on projects I enjoy playing FPS games, watching eSports and reading fantasy novels.
