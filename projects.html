NeoAuto is a Python automation program for the popular HTML game Neopets, that
uses Selenium to collect daily items and feed a user's pet. This started
off as a final assignment for my Python class. After submitting it for a
grade I decided to work on it some more, extending the application to
work for all users, add more features, and make it available for public
use.
